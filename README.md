# DISCORD PROJECT REPOSITORY

This repository will include many different discord projects, some being node.js and some being in python. If you wish to download one of them, unfortunately you must download all of them as i personally like the current layout that i have. If any of the following projects require tutorials they will be listed below this so please scroll down if you need help.


# DISCORD AUTO MESSAGE HELP:

- All of the libaries used should be built-in unless you are using a very early version of python, in which case update to the newest version.
- You do not have to name your file message.txt but it must be in the same directory and must include raw text of your message that is going to be sent.
- A config file will be automatically created if you do not have one and you may change it at anytime when reloading the program.
- If you need extra help, try reaching out to someone who can read the code - it's quite easy to follow and i've added some small comments.
